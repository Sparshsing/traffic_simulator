How this app was developed.

1. Saw a YT video explaining about flyovers and intersections.
2. Got inspiration to model traffic flow and see whats the effect of different intersections on the traffic.
3. Decided to create an application.
4. created default nextjs project with settings as typescript, tailwind css, app router.
5. Asked chatgpt to create basic app with raods and moving vehicles.
5. got the code running after several errors (mostly due to imports, client or server components)
6. Thought for the design of the app. Designed models, setup and the flow actions.
7. For setting up roads and lanes, I needed to define their positions and relations.
8. To do this, created a page to draw lines and do linkings.
